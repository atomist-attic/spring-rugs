    Then the class source file contains the class name
    Then the class source file contains the package name
    Then the class source file should not contain the original class name
    Then the class source file should not contain the original package name
    Then the class test file exists
    Then the class test file contains the class name
    Then the class test file contains the package name
    Then the class test file should not contain the original class name
    Then the class test file should not contain the original package name
    Then the POM file contains the artifact ID
    Then the POM file contains the version
