This [Rug](http://docs.atomist.com/) archive contains a Generator for
a Spring Boot Rest Service project.

## Rugs

### NewSpringBootRestService

The NewSpringBootRestService Generator creates a new [Sprint
Boot][boot] [REST][rest] service project.

[boot]: https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
[rest]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this generator.

#### Parameters

To run this editor, you must supply the following parameters.

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
-------------------------------------------
| `project_name` | Yes | |  A valid GitHub repository name.  It must be 21 characters or less to avoid truncating name when the its Slack channel is created. |
| `artifact_id` | No | myartifact | Maven artifact ID, e.g., "fiddle-riddle". |
| `group_id` | No | mygroup |  Maven group ID, e.g., "com.pany.project". |
| `version` | No | 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT | [Semantic version][semver] of the project. |
| `description` | No | My new project | A brief description of the project. |
| `root_package` | No | com.myorg | The root package for the generated service class. |
| `service_class_name` | No | MyService | Name for the generated service class. |

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:NewSpringBootRestService \
    pet-shop-service \
    artifact_id=pet-shop \
    group_id=uk.co.lndn \
    version=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    description="Spring Boot REST service for selling stuff" \
    root_package=uk.co.lndn.electronic \
    service_class_name=PetShop
```

Note the first parameter, the `project_name`, is different in that you
do not need to supply the name of the parameter, just the value.  This
is because the `project_name` parameter is required for all
generators.  This will create a directory named `pet-shop-service` add
populate it with a working Spring Boot REST service.  If you are happy
with the change, commit the changes.

```
$ cd pet-shop-service
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial version generated by Atomist'
```
